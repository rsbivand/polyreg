The t-sne method, implemented in R in the Rtsne package, is a method for
nonlinear projection of data into a two- (or higher) dimensional
submanifold, just like plotting the first 2 principle components in PCA.

But as is typical with ML/DL algorithms, t-sne is finicky; choose the
wrong values for tuning parameters, and you get garbage.  See the
excellent account at

So, prVis() seems like a good alternative.  It simply calls getPoly() to
generate the polynomial expansion of the data, then does PCA.  No tuning
parameters!

The umap package is said to be similar to t-sne but faster.
