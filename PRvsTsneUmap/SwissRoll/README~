Artificial dataset generated as mixture of 4 bivariate normals,
followed by adding a third variable, using

(x,y) -> (x cos x, y, x sin x)

and then seeing what happens when we project back down to 2 dimensions.

1.  PCA creates a swirl-like image, a continuous curve, hiding the fact
that the data originated with 4 separate components; can we recover
them, at least a hint of them?

2.  t-sne seems to hint that there are between 3 and 5 components.

3.  prVis() seems to suggest 4 components.
