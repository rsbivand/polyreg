Forest Cover data.

On subsample of 15000, Rtsne took 739 seconds, prVis 393.

Not much to distinguish between the 2.  Both suggest some difficulty in
the classification problem, distinguishing between the red and black
classes, and between the blue and purple.

cvr <- read.csv('~/Research/DataSets/ForestCover/covtype.data',header=F)
cvr[,55] <- as.factor(cvr[,55])
system.time(prVis(cvr,nSubSam=15000))
idxs <- sample(1:nrow(cvr),15000)
cvr15000 <- cvr[idxs,]
system.time(plot(Rtsne(cvr15000[,-55])$Y,col=cvr15000[,55]))

The results for a subsample of size 2000 are similar.  Here t-sne was
slightly faster than prVis, 40s to 51 s.
